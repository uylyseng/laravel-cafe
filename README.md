Please ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

1. **PHP (v8.2 or higher)**: Ensure both PHP CLI and extensions required by Laravel are properly installed.
2. **Composer**: For managing PHP packages ([Get Composer](https://getcomposer.org)).
3. **Node.js (v18 or higher)**: Used for managing frontend dependencies ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)).
4. **NPM**: Comes with Node.js installation.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**

   Fork the repository to your GitHub account and clone it locally.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install PHP Dependencies**

   Run the following command to install the backend dependencies.

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Install Node.js Dependencies**

   Use npm to install front-end packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up the Environment File**

   Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env` and adjust the necessary configuration.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Key configuration to modify:
    - **Database**: Ensure the `DB_CONNECTION` is set to `sqlite` and set the path to your SQLite database file.
    - **Queue**: Make sure `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database` is enabled in `.env`.

5. **Generate Application Key**

   Generate the Laravel application key:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Run Database Migrations**

   Run the migrations to set up database schema:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Run the Development Server**

   To serve the application locally:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   The application will be served at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

8. **Frontend Build and Watch**

   Run the following command for development to build and watch frontend changes:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## Code Style and Standards

### PHP
Use [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/pint) to ensure the code adheres to Laravel's coding standards. Run the following to check and fix code style:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pint
```

### JavaScript & CSS
Follow the implemented `eslint` and `stylelint` rules (if any). Ensure your JavaScript code and CSS adhere to TailwindCSS and project specifications.

---

## Testing

1. **Backend Tests**

   Be sure all existing tests pass before submitting your changes. Use PHPUnit for testing:

   ```bash
   php artisan test
   ```

2. **Frontend Tests**

   There are no predefined frontend tests, but contributors may choose to add them using preferred testing tools.

---

## Committing and Pushing Changes

1. **Follow Commit Standards**

   Use clear and concise commit messages. For example:
    - `fix: Resolve database migration issue`
    - `feat: Add user profile page`
    - `docs: Update Contributing guidelines`

2. **Pull Requests**

   Once your feature or fix branch is pushed, create a pull request to the repository's main branch with the following:
    - A clear summary of what the PR does.
    - Mention any issues fixed by your PR (e.g., Closes #123).
